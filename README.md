### Documentation 

##### Options:

If you don't want these methods added to the window object simply modify the imediate function to pass the JavaScript object of your choosing.

##### Methods:

- **publish** *(`String` topic, `Array?` args)*

	- summary: 
		- Publish some data on a named topic.
	
	- topic: `String`
		- The channel to publish on
	
	- args: `Array?`
		- Optional data to publish. Each array item is converted into ordered arguments on the subscribed functions. 
	
	- example:
		- Publish stuff on '/some/topic'. Anything subscribed will be called with a function signature like: function(a,b,c){ ... }

		  ```javascript
		  publish("/some/topic", ["a","b","c"]);
		  ```

- **subscribe** *(`String` topic, `Function` callback)*

	- summary:
		- Register a callback on a named topic.

	- topic: `String`
		- The channel to subscribe to

	- callback: `Function`
		- The handler event. Anytime something is publish'ed on a subscribed channel, the callback will be called with the published array as ordered arguments.

	- returns: `Array`
		- A handle which can be used to unsubscribe this particular subscription.

	- example:

		  ```javascript
		  subscribe("/some/topic", function(a, b, c){ /* handle data */ });
		  ```

- **unsubscribe** *(`Array` handle)*

	- summary:
		- Disconnect a subscribed function for a topic.

	- handle: `Array`
		- The return value from a subscribe call.
	
	- example:

		```javascript
		var handle = subscribe("/some/topic", function(){});
		unsubscribe(handle);
		  ```
